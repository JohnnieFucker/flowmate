# Flowmate

Don't draw a shpae and type text. Just tell your process only text and make shpae with the text. It's just speedy and super simple. 

Just text the label first,

And press "Ctrl+Shift+P" or "Ctrl+Shift+D" and so on.

# Special Thanks

2. The style of chart is based on "Communicating Design 2nd edition" by Dan brown. His book is one of the best UX book in my opinion.
