# Flowmate

Don't draw a shpae and type text. Just write your story, process or task only text first and make shpaes with the text. It's just speedy and super simple. 

## Step 1
Just text the label first,

## Step 2
And press magic keys like 
* Ctrl+Shift+P : Process 
* Ctrl+Shift+D : Decision
* Ctrl+Shift+L : Label
* Ctrl+Shift+R : Reference
* Ctrl+Shift+C : Connect

# To do

- [ ] Smart align - to align Decision and other symbol
- [ ] Smart connect - really hard :-(
- [ ] Option dialog

The flowmate is inspired by AEFlowchart. The concept is great and I use some functions. Thanks tajiaj!

The style of chart is based on [Communicating Design 2nd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463) by Dan Brown. His book is one of the best UX book in my opinion even he doesn't know me ;-)
