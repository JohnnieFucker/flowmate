# Flowmate

Don't draw a shpae and type text. Just tell your process only text and make shpae with the text. It's just speedy and super simple. 

Just text the label first,

And press magic keys like 
* Ctrl+Shift+P : Process 
* Ctrl+Shift+D : Decision
* Ctrl+Shift+C : Connect
* Ctrl+Shift+S : Start/End

# Special Thanks

2. The style of chart is based on "Communicating Design 2nd edition" by Dan brown. His book is one of the best UX book in my opinion.
