# Flowmate

Don't draw a shpae and type text. Write your story, process or task first, then make shpaes with the text automatically. It's just speedy and super simple. 

## Installing Plugin

1. [Download the flowmate Zip file](https://github.com/wodory/flowmate/archive/master.zip) and extract it. 
2. Copy the folder to the plugin folder (Open up Sketch, and go to `Plugins` › `Reveal Plugins Folder…` to open it.)
3. The 'flowmate' plugin is appeared in the `Plugins` menu.

## How to Use 

### Step 1
Just text the label first,

The flowmate is inspired by AEFlowchart. The concept is great and I use some functions. Thanks tajiaj!

##### Dan brown

The style of chart is based on [Communicating Design 2nd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463) by Dan Brown. His book is one of the best UX book in my opinion even he doesn't know me ;-)
